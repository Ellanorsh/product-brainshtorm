Based on that understanding, prepare a list of existing competing or similar services where this feature is well implemented. For each service, add a brief comment explaining why you believe the feature is well implemented there and whether it has any additional unique aspects. For example: if the request describes changes to a registration form, an ideal result would be a list of services with clear and user-friendly registration forms, highlighting that one service has great UI solutions, another has helpful guidance for users, and a third has a clean and minimalistic design that keeps the user focused."

Both plans must include preliminary estimates for the number of developer hours, testing, and any other specialists required."
